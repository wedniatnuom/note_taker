# Note Taker

## Description

- Project Motivation: I wanted to learn how to use express and build routes to make functional crud requests.

- Purpose: The acceptance criteria was to have an app that would allow a business owner to be able to write and save notes allowing them to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks needing completion.

- What did it solve: It aids in removing disorganization from a busy schedule.

- What I learned along the way: Primarily, I learned more about how to actually create routes and how they function. I also got a nice refresher on fs and how to use it.

## Installation

Steps required to get off the ground: An NPM install is all that is required. Outside of that, the product will run live.

## Usage

How to use: Once at the live site click "Get Started" to enter into your note taking application. From there you can click the + in the top right hand corner to create a new note. Once a title and text has been entered a save icon will appear allowing you to save your current note to the left column on the page. Clicking on your note on the left will bring it back up to the right to be viewed.
